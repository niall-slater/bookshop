Untitled bookshop game
=======

## A simple game about running a bookshop.

This game is designed to run in-browser using the [Phaser.io game library](phaser.io) for Javascript and HTML5. It also uses the simple but excellent [SlickUI](https://github.com/Flaxis/slick-ui), a lightweight UI plugin for Phaser.

You'll see the code is structured using a basic state machine, very similar to the one set out in [this tutorial](http://perplexingtech.weebly.com/game-dev-blog/using-states-in-phaserjs-javascript-game-developement).
